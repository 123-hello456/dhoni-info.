    Mahendra Singh Dhoni, fondly called as Mahi by his teammates, is a retired Indian cricketer who played as a wicket-keeper-batsman. He captained the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. Dhoni is known for his calm captaincy and his ability to finish matches in tight situations. He led the Indian team to several victories including <u>the 2007 ICC World Twenty20</u>, <u>the 2011 Cricket World Cup</u>, and <u>the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy</u>.<br><br>
    Dhoni made his ODI debut in 2004 against Bangladesh and quickly rose to fame with his aggressive batting style. His unbeaten 183 against Sri Lanka in 2005 remains one of the highest scores by a wicketkeeper in ODIs. Under his leadership, India became the number one Test team in the world. He was also the captain of Chennai Super Kings in the IPL, leading them to multiple titles and becoming one of the most successful captains in T20 franchise cricket.
